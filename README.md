# discord-vnlogbot

A Discord bot for tracking personal reading statistics.

## Planned features

* Users can submit a "session log" containing a 字・行 count for a reading session, storing it in a database.
* Given a date, users can get statistics on their reading like lines/hour, average line length, and more. 
* With enough data, users can view trends in their reading habits with data visualizations such as charts.
* VNDB integration of some sort.
